Configuration Management Script Documentation
Introduction

The Configuration Management Script is a Python script designed to manage and monitor the configuration of network devices and servers. This script helps ensure that security policies are applied consistently across the environment and prevent misconfigurations that could introduce vulnerabilities.
Requirements

The Configuration Management Script requires Python 3.x to be installed on the system. It also requires the following Python modules to be installed:

    os
    subprocess
    logging

Installation

    Download the Configuration Management Script from the GitHub repository.
    Install Python 3.x on the system if it is not already installed.
    Install the required Python modules using pip: pip install os subprocess logging
    Run the script using the command python config_management.py.

Usage

Upon running the script, the user is presented with a menu that allows them to choose between different options. The available options are:

    1: Retrieve current state
    2: Compare current state to desired state
    3: Apply changes to bring current state in line with desired state
    4: Exit

Option 1: Retrieve current state

This option retrieves the current state of the configuration items and displays them on the screen. The configuration items that are retrieved are:

    Firewall rules
    Access controls
    System settings

Option 2: Compare current state to desired state

This option compares the current state of the configuration items to the desired state defined in the script. If any differences are found, the script displays a list of the changes that need to be made to bring the current state in line with the desired state.
Option 3: Apply changes to bring current state in line with desired state

This option applies the changes needed to bring the current state of the configuration items in line with the desired state. If any errors occur during the application of changes, the script logs an error message to the config_management.log file.
Option 4: Exit

This option exits the script.
Logging

The Configuration Management Script logs all events and changes to the config_management.log file. This log file is useful for monitoring and auditing purposes.
