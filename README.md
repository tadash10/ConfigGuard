# ConfigGuard

The Configuration Management Tool is a Python script designed to help users manage and maintain the desired state of various configuration items on their system. It allows users to define a desired state, compare it with the current state, and apply changes to bring the system in line with the desired state.
Installation

    Clone the repository or download the script from the GitHub page:

bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/configuration-management-tool.git
cd configuration-management-tool

    Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

    Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

The Configuration Management Tool supports several features that can be accessed through the command line interface.

bash

python config_management.py [--config-file CONFIG_FILE]

Optional arguments:

    --config-file CONFIG_FILE: Path to the configuration file containing the desired state (default: desired_state.json).

Menu Options

    View Current State: Display the current state of the configuration items.

    View Desired State: Display the desired state defined in the configuration file.

    Compare States: Compare the current state with the desired state and show the changes needed to achieve the desired state.

    Apply Changes: Apply changes to bring the system in line with the desired state. Users will be prompted for confirmation before applying the changes.

    Exit: Exit the script.

Interactive Mode

The Configuration Management Tool offers an interactive setup process to guide users through initial configuration, such as setting up logging preferences and other options. Users can interactively review and confirm individual changes before applying them.
Configuration File

The tool supports loading the desired state from a configuration file in JSON format. The default configuration file is desired_state.json, but you can specify a different file using the --config-file command-line argument.
Logging

The script logs all actions and changes to the config_management.log file for monitoring purposes.
Important Notes

    Use at Your Own Risk: This script is provided as-is without warranty of any kind. Use it at your own risk and ensure you have backups of critical configuration files before applying changes.

    Validation and Testing: The script includes functions for validating the desired state and automated testing to ensure its reliability. However, we recommend users to thoroughly test the script in their environment before applying changes to critical systems.

    Integration with Configuration Management Tools: The script allows integration with popular configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef. Users can set up specific configuration management tools during the interactive configuration setup process.

    Secure Input Handling: The tool uses secure input handling functions to read sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys) from the user or configuration files, providing an added layer of security.

    User-friendly Messages: The script offers clear instructions and information through user-friendly messages during different stages of its execution.

    Support for Multiple Configuration Tools: The tool supports multiple configuration management tools, allowing users to choose the one that best fits their environment.
